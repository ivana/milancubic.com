    <p>It is very convenient to create your agenda for today by tapping the Today icon in the toolbar.</p>
    <p>Notice that the checkboxes transform into a star. Simply tap an item to show it in the Today list. Tap the item again to remove it from Today.</p>
    <p>We wanted this MacBook Pro to have a screen as vivid as your imagination.</p>
    <p>A screen where everything you see is remarkably vibrant, detailed, and sharp.</p>
    <p>The new Retina display reduces glare while maintaining incredible color and quality. In fact, it has a 29 percent higher contrast ratio than a standard MacBook Pro display.</p>
    <p>Blacks are blacker. Whites are whiter. And everything in between is rich and vibrant. IPS technology gives you a wide, 178-degree view of everything on the screen, so you’ll see the difference at practically any angle. And you’re going to love what you see.</p>
